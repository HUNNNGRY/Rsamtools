Update Rsamtools to use htslib 1.7
==================================

Some context
------------

Rsamtools 1.33.0 contains a copy of an old (8-10 year old?) version of the
samtools and tabix C code.

The latest version of samtools is 1.8 (as of May 9, 2018):

  http://www.htslib.org/

In the recent years the samtools code has been split into samtools + htslib.
Most of the code that used to be in samtools is now in htslib. The latest
version of htslib is also 1.8.

Note that a decently recent version of htslib (version 1.7) is wrapped in a
Bioconductor package: Rhtslib

Migration status
----------------

In Rsamtools 1.99.0, every was migrated to Rhtslib, except asBcf() and razip()
(for the later, this is due to RAZF no longer being provided with recent
samtools).
Also, eventhough applyPileups() was migrated (pileupbam.c), it fails to pass
a few tests.
